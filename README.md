# The Challenge

Given 4 tables and their example outputs, solve 3 tasks

  - User
  - Sessions  
  - Location
  - Actions

## Setting up the environment

1) Table creation

I have created the tables using the CreateTables.sql script included in this repository, and ran it in a cloud SQL environment.

2) Test data generation

There were up to 2 example values per table, so in order to test the queries, I used an online service named mockaroo that allows you to generate up to 1000 random rows.

## The Tasks

Each of the tasks have their own sql file. All of them were executed in the environment and returned the expected outputs.

### Files
-SQL FILE: task1.sql  
-Output : Query1.csv

-SQL FILE: Task2.sql  
-Output : Query2.csv

-SQL FILE: Task3.sql  
-Output : Query3.csv
